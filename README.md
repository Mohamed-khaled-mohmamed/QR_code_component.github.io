## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to effectively use semantic HTML and CSS custom properties. 


### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on improving my JavaScript skills and exploring more advanced CSS techniques, such as CSS Grid.

### Useful resources
  - [CSS LAYOUTS](https://almdrasa.com/tracks/frontend/courses/css-layouts/)  -  Helped me understand Flexbox and other CSS concepts better.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - An invaluable resource for web development documentation.
